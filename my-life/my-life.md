## My Life (Ringo's Desert)

#### Inspired by ZHU's live rendition of Ringo's Desert - ATX [2018(?)]

I stood shivering, on an ocean of sand\
Stranded on the beach, of a faraway land\
Wondering to myself, when I'd see home again\
Curious even more, when the cold would set in

Hypnotic crashed the waves, lapping on the cliffs\
How beautiful the place, but how distant was bliss\
I dreamed of her arms, and the warm embrace\
Gentle smile, the soft glow radiating from her face

Palms towered above, like specters of God\
Spectators silent, to the path I trod\
So wandered my mind, back to the place I once dreamed\
Once a bright place, but now only the water gleamed

Even the waves, only servants of a reminder\
That never could I return, never would I find her\
Nothing more left to feel, and even less to hope\
I gave in to the inevitable, falling down the slope

But where I saw water, just but a mirage\
Land and sky meeting, in a shimmering collage\
My love just as elusive, a figment merely of the mind\
Darkness the only remainder, where her light once shined

I contemplated quietly the promises never kept\
The way I embarked, how she might have wept\
I said that once I'd return, having walked the seven seas\
But all that rang in my head, were her departing pleas

It's true, the whole earth I have traveled\
Mysteries of life and being I unravelled\
But none of the times filled the empty void\
That time and space had by now destroyed

It's said distance makes the heart grow fonder\
It is only with a broken heart do I wander\
Deserts of the mind endless as they are barren\
The one I walk, a vast expanse to drown in

I hope for a direction, pray for an answer\
Dunes undulating in currents, flowing like a dancer\
Just like she used to, spin an enchanting trance\
Wrenching my body and mind, with barely even a glance

Not what to feel, or even what to think\
Images of the past life, flash by with each blink\
Has the desert induced mania, was it this way before\
If only I could know, what brought on days of yore

Might I be able to return back, to a better time\
For now my only solace in paper, and recorded in rhyme\
Not perfection or even a simile\
But this next mountain anyways I must climb
