## Battle 

#### Inpsired by Jedi Mind Tricks and Army of the Pharaohs

My quest to vanquish,\
A beast unseen,\
Second letter capital,\
Big B is a hive, the queen,\

Honey draws me closer,\
A dionysian trap,\
Hedonism beckons,\
Its hidden treasures, a map

My quadrant unknown,\
Destination, my foe,\
Approach should I fast,\
Or with method, slow

Important my tactics,\
Strategy, now plotted,\
Twists, turns nonstop this,\
Chessboard of life, knotted

In battle my strength,\
Your surrender, my power,\
Like a rook I move,\
Tall above you, tower

In battle, my strength,\
Your surrender, my power,\
Like a rook, I move,\
Tall above you, tower

Through fog and flames,\
Deceptive the smoke,\
Pull the wool over your eyes,\
Fleece you like Jason, a cloak

Fight to the death,\
I won't be in hell,\
Best team black magic,\
To greet Hades, a Spell
