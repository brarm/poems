## Dark 

#### Inpsired by the Night

I wander lonely,\
Broken heart,\
I find it now,\
Cleaved apart

Along the path,\
Sadness surround,\
Flowers in bloom,\
All I see, the ground

To which ashes,\
Fall and scatter,\
All is burned,\
None does matter

Solitary my,\
search, alone my quest,\
Nomadic my soul,\
And far away, is rest

Demons in chase,\
I dare not delay,\
Their breath I feel,\
Time not even to pray

For the prey is,\
me, hunter as well,\
Pursuit of shadow,\
Darkness a spell

The tunnel long,\
Only now entered,\
Wherever I plant,\
On me stays centered

Light draws distant,\
At my approach,\
All that I feel,\
Fear, its encroach

Salvation fiction,\
A deception, bare lie,\
Hard as I wish,\
As much as I try

Even the silence,\
Holds for me no peace,\
Amplifying terror, heavy,\
Maw of the Beast

Discover, on this quest,\
Parts of my soul,\
All that I can request,\
That by the end, somehow,\
I can make it whole.
