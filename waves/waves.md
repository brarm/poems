## Waves 

#### Inpsired by The Ocean

The water speaks to me,\
It has its own song,\
Flowed has it far,\
Traveled has it long.

A message in the harmony,\
Just out of reach,\
Why does it talk,\
What does it teach?

Sit on the bank,\
Feet in the waves,\
Hearing the whispers,\
My soul the sound saves.

Or are they saviours,\
Of a fractured heart,\
Its journey treacherous,\
Is this a quiet start?

Following the trail,\
Back to the source,\
Where I arrive there,\
Will it value the course?

Or do I lack choice,\
Just as the waves flow,\
Perhaps I must release,\
Trust the Universe,\
And Just Let Go.
