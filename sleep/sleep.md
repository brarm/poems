## Waves 

#### Inpsired by Somnolesence

Not that tired,\
Neither am awake,\
My body wired,\
To some limbo state.

For bliss of slumber,\
I toil and wait,\
Counting each sheep, number,\
None do my mind, sate.

Dreams of sleep,\
Drift by, cascade,\
Thoughts sneak and creep,\
Like elephants on parade.

Why torrtures this beast,\
When respite all I seek,\
Ravenous, it feasts,\
It's prey weary, weak

Fatigue, the appetite feeds,\
Empowering the monster,\
Satisfying its needs,\
Why do I taunt her?

Not awake or yet dreaming,\
Uneasy, turn and toss,\
Mind gives up, screaming,\
My sanity the only loss
