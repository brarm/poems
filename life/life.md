## Life 

#### Inpsired by ... the Universe ?

A journey this life is,\
Travel through time and space,\
Stranded on a strange rock,\ 
What is this universe, our place?

Should the answer we ponder,\
The question significant,\
Our existence our being ,\
In fact, life magnificent.

Whether God there be,\
A higher power above,\
The  chance hard to dismiss,\
Accept all as total, just love, 

Except those that deny,\
Their reasons they have too,\
Though their beliefs different,\
Not be they any less true 

From one place we came,\
Back to the same we go,\
Together on this road,\
Life on stage, a show. 

We are all actors,\
To each other‘s screenplay,\
Our choice the roles we take,\ 
Even how long we might stay.

Many enter the scene,\
Even more do depart,\
Often the grand gamble,\
To attempt, make a start

Many miles to travel,\
More to go before sleep,\
All I ask so I rest,\
My promises. I keep, 

The frost settles soft,\ 
Cold blanket on the ground,\
Looking up heavens,\
These would speak not a sound.

Yet there be somewhere near,\
At the same time distant,\
A chord quiet unstuck,\
It vibrations, persistent 

Flowing through my essence,\
Shaping past future now,\
It’s form unknown mystery,\
To the grace I still bow,\

These ties that ever bind,\
Cannot ignore hold the mind,\
Grasp my hand come with, along,\
Mehtaab, my name, this - my song
