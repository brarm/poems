## Pride 

#### Inpsired by Heartbreak

Thought you were a constant,
Turned out to be a variable,
How does the heart solve an equation,
When the soul feels so terrible?

Gave you a part of myself,
And just asked you to return it,
Instead you made your own choice,
To break me apart, to just burn it

Now the pieces I'm left to collect,
Scattered as they are far and wide,
If it wasn't my surface you hurt,
Did you think twice, what of my pride?

The pride, my ego within,
A monstrous foe to slay,
Which arms must I collect,
to keep the Beast at bay?

When it feeds offf the pain,
My trust in you brought,
This feels of a battle that,
I've lost before I fought.

The protagonist is me,
The antagonist the same,
Can I outsmart the enemy,
Without rules to the game?

Or is it simply that,
Rule I find unfair,
One side demands them,
The other could not care.

A truce out of the question,
A ceasefire out of sight,
Perhaps the final solution,
To walk away from the fight.

No ned to spar an enemy,
Lacking in malice or rage,
Raise the sword up high,
But the battle, he won't engage.

To win I must lose,
TO find first get lost,
Our paths, like swords,
Be they eternally uncrossed.
