## Waves 

#### Inpsired by Addiction

The deadly sticks,\
I do so crave,\
Are these feelings,\
Possible to stave?

Not for the rush,\
Even for the taste,\
Perhaps I just enjoy,\.
My organs, to go waste

Enjoy the next,\
Less than the last,\
No joy, no pleasure,\
Just a time pass.

Or are they more,\
A deadly habit,\
One offered outstreched,\
I want to grab it.

Maybe it holds,\
Onto my mind,\
Maybe I just let it,\
They respond in kind.

Possible this be,\
A time to learn,\
The chance, upon me but,\
What's another, to burn?
